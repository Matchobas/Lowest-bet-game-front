### Lowest Bet Game

First version of a cliet side to the Lowest Bet Game, a simple game that I'm doing for subject in college. The game take auctions from a server API and puts on a timer for an item, until the end of the timer multple people can make bets on the site, and at the end of the timer the lowest bet with NO duplicate bets is the winner of the item.
